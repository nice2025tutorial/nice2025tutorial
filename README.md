# Tutorial: Development and Deployment of SNNs on FPGA for Embedded Applications

This tutorial provided a comprehensive walkthrough of our toolchain, designed to streamline the development and deployment of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) onto our (unreleased) custom event-based neuromorphic accelerator hardware. Attendees gained hands-on experience with model configuration, training, quantization, and hardware export, enabling them to optimize neural networks for real-world applications.

The tutorial was presented at the NICE Workshop 2025 in Heidelberg in a hands-on live session. The Docker container that was provided for the tutorial is no longer publicly available, since it was targeted only towards providing the dependencies of the preliminary toolchain for the tutorial. We are still actively working on the project and plan on releasing it as an open-source project within this year (2025), so keep posted for updates.
